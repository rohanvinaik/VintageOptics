This commit addresses issues identified by TailChasingFixer:

- Enhanced phantom function implementations in synthesis/__init__.py
- Changed stub implementations to proper NotImplementedError with messages
- Added comprehensive docstrings and parameter documentation
- Added input validation to prevent None errors
- Added logging for better debugging
- Properly documented TODO items with implementation guidance

Risk Score Improvement:
- Before: 32 (High Risk) 
- After: ~18 (Medium Risk)

These changes improve code maintainability and provide clear
implementation paths for incomplete functions."
