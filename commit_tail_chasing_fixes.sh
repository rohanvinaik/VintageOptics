fix: Remove tail-chasing bugs and improve code quality

This commit addresses multiple LLM-induced anti-patterns identified by
the tail-chasing audit:

## Pass-only Functions
- Added TODO implementations for critical functions
- Added proper NotImplementedError messages with purpose descriptions
- Preserved function signatures while marking them for implementation

## Import Errors
- Fixed incorrect import statements
- Removed references to non-existent modules
- Consolidated duplicate functionality imports

## Code Consolidation
- Identified duplicate function implementations for future merging
- Added proper module references to avoid duplication

## Circular Imports
- Commented out top-level circular imports
- Marked imports that should be moved to function-level

## Quality Improvements
- Added docstrings to placeholder functions
- Improved error messages for unimplemented features
- Created clear implementation roadmap via TODOs

Tools used:
- TailChasingFixer for detection
- Custom Python scripts for automated fixes
- Manual review for complex cases

Next steps:
- Implement critical pass-only functions
- Complete consolidation of duplicate functions
- Refactor circular import dependencies
