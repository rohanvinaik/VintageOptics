fix: Apply TailChasingFixer recommendations to improve code quality

This commit addresses the issues identified by TailChasingFixer analysis:

## Fixes Applied:

### 1. Enhanced Phantom Function Implementations
- Updated synthesis/__init__.py with proper docstrings and error handling
- Changed stub implementations to raise NotImplementedError with clear messages
- Added TODO documentation with implementation guidance

### 2. Improved Error Handling
- Added try-catch blocks to critical functions
- Added input validation to prevent None errors
- Included proper logging for debugging

### 3. Code Documentation
- Added comprehensive docstrings to previously undocumented functions
- Properly formatted TODO items with dates and descriptions
- Added type hints preparation for better code clarity

### 4. Circular Import Prevention
- Verified and maintained the existing circular import fixes
- Kept data classes in __init__.py to avoid dependencies

## Risk Score Improvements:
- Previous risk score: 32 (High)
- Estimated new score: <20 (Medium)

## Benefits:
- Better error messages for developers
- Clear implementation roadmap via TODOs
- Reduced tail-chasing patterns
- Improved code maintainability

Tools used:
- TailChasingFixer for analysis
- Custom Python scripts for automated fixes
- Manual review for complex cases

Next steps:
- Implement the documented TODO functions
- Run TailChasingFixer again to verify improvements
- Continue monitoring with pre-commit hooks
