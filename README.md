# VintageOptics

Advanced lens correction system with character preservation for vintage and modern lenses.

## Overview

VintageOptics is an open-source lens correction system that goes beyond simple geometric corrections. It's designed to preserve the unique character of vintage lenses while removing distracting defects, implementing the philosophy of "corrected but not clinical."

- **Optical Fingerprinting**: Unique signatures for individual lens copies
- **Manual Lens Detection**: Pattern matching in metadata for adapted vintage lenses
- **Lensfun Integration**: Access to 1000+ lens profiles from the open-source database

### üßπ Intelligent Defect Cleanup
- **Defect Detection**: Identifies dust, scratches, fungus, coating wear, haze, and oil spots
- **Character Preservation**: Distinguishes between defects and character-adding imperfections
- **Adaptive Cleanup**: Different strategies for different types of defects

## Quick Start

```python
from vintageoptics import VintageOpticsPipeline
from vintageoptics.core import ProcessingRequest, ProcessingMode

# Initialize pipeline
pipeline = VintageOpticsPipeline('config/default.yaml')

# Process an image with standard correction
request = ProcessingRequest(
    image_path='path/to/image.jpg',
    mode=ProcessingMode.CORRECT,
    output_path='path/to/corrected.jpg',
    preserve_metadata=True
)

result = pipeline.process(request)
print(f"Lens detected: {result.lens_profile}")
print(f"Corrections applied: {result.quality_metrics}")

# Or use the hybrid physics-ML approach
request.mode = ProcessingMode.HYBRID
result = pipeline.process(request)
print(f"Converged in {result.iterations} iterations")
print(f"ML confidence: {result.ml_confidence:.2f}")
```

### Vintage ML Detection

Use classic machine learning for transparent defect detection:

```python
from vintageoptics.vintageml import VintageMLDefectDetector

detector = VintageMLDefectDetector(config)
results = detector.detect_defects(image)

for result in results:
    print(f"Detected {result.defect_type} using {result.method_used}")
    print(f"Confidence: {result.confidence:.2f}")
```

Train on your own data:

```python
from vintageoptics.vintageml import VintageMLTrainer

trainer = VintageMLTrainer(config)
trainer.train(
    data_dir='path/to/training/data',
    save_path='models/my_vintage_ml.pkl'
)
```

## Advanced Usage

### Creating Lens Instance Profiles

```python
from vintageoptics.detection import UnifiedLensDetector

detector = UnifiedLensDetector(config)

# Detect lens
detection_result = detector.detect_comprehensive({'path': 'image.jpg'})

# Create instance profile with calibration images
calibration_images = [...]  # Load multiple images from same lens
fingerprint = detector.create_instance_profile(
    detection_result,
    calibration_images
)
```

### Character Preservation Modes

```python
# Adaptive mode (default) - adapts based on content
request.settings = {'preservation_mode': 'adaptive'}

# Full preservation - maximum character retention
request.settings = {'preservation_mode': 'full'}

# Artistic mode - enhances desirable characteristics
request.settings = {'preservation_mode': 'artistic'}
```

### Batch Processing

```python
results = pipeline.batch_process(
    input_dir='path/to/images',
    output_dir='path/to/output',
    mode=ProcessingMode.CORRECT,
    preserve_character=True
)
```

## Configuration

The system is highly configurable through YAML files:

- `config/default.yaml`: Standard processing configuration
- `config/synthesis.yaml`: Lens synthesis settings
- `config/depth_aware.yaml`: Depth-based processing

Example configuration:

```yaml
character_preservation:
  mode: adaptive
  strength: 0.7
  
cleanup:
  dust_sensitivity: 0.8
  preserve_character: true
  
physics:
  model_selection: adaptive
  preserve_bokeh: true
```

## Philosophy

VintageOptics is built on the principle that lens "imperfections" often contribute to the artistic quality of images. Our goal is to remove distracting defects while preserving the unique rendering characteristics that give vintage lenses their charm.

Unlike clinical correction software that aims for mathematical perfection, VintageOptics:
- Preserves beneficial aberrations like smooth bokeh and gentle vignetting
- Maintains lens-specific rendering styles
- Adapts corrections based on image content
- Allows fine control over character preservation

### Vintage ML Approach

Our "AI-winter first" philosophy extends to defect detection. By using classic algorithms from the 1950s-1980s as the primary layer:
- **Transparency**: Every decision is interpretable - you can inspect perceptron weights and decision boundaries
- **Education**: Learn ML history through working implementations of foundational algorithms
- **Efficiency**: Runs on CPU without GPU requirements, suitable for real-time processing
- **Effectiveness**: These simple algorithms often suffice for detecting dust, scratches, and other defects

The system uses modern ML only as a fallback for complex cases, maintaining our commitment to explainable, character-preserving processing.
