git commit -m "Fix tail-chasing bugs and improve architecture

- Fixed UnifiedDetector -> UnifiedLensDetector naming issues
- Removed ComparisonAnalyzer references (now uses QualityAnalyzer)
- Consolidated duplicate detector implementations
- Cleaned up circular dependencies and phantom imports
- Added compatibility module for backward compatibility
- Implemented placeholder functions with basic functionality
- Created comprehensive documentation (TAIL_CHASING_REPORT.md, IMPORT_MAP.md)
- Added validation scripts and analysis tools
- Cleaned up __pycache__ and orphaned .pyc files

This commit addresses the 'tail-chasing bug' pattern where LLM-assisted
development created circular fixes instead of addressing root causes."
